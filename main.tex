\begin{abstract}
Cars are ubiquitous in our modern lifestyles, unfortunately, the software systems in them do not keep up with other computing systems that we use. In this report, we aim to show how we tackled the problems and areas for improvement that we found in current car systems. Five areas of a modern car's feature set were focused on weekly, these being; the dashboard, media, navigation, safety and an accompanying smartphone app.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Introduction}
For years car companies have invested relatively little into their car's information systems and technological abilities. Inbuilt Sat Nav systems are often hard to use, update and are counter-intuitive. Since car companies are slow to adopt new technologies, even features that would have been possible many many years ago have not been widely used yet. For example, we still use the physical dials in the instrument cluster that we have used for years.

We have created an attractive and modern solution for digital technology in a car that we hope to see in future modern cars in production. In section~\ref{sec:system-design} we will give explain the technical elements of our system design that can be found ranging from navigation to safety features. In section~\ref{sec:nav} we will go into detail on the design process of our navigation system. In section~\ref{sec:app} we will go into detail on the design process of our accompanying smartphone app.

        \end{itemize}
      \item Something for tiredness detection
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Structures} \label{ssec:data-structures}
For our navigation algorithm we decided to model the map as a set of nodes and edges where junctions, the start and the destination are nodes and the edges are the roads between these nodes.

\subsection{Communications \& Data Flows} \label{ssec:communications-data}
Within our system, we have communications between the Mobile App, the Car and our Cloud, with links to external APIs. Communications between the car and the phone consist of initial connection, instructions and data transfer. Establishing a connection is done by pairing the phone to the car by means of NFC, this will authenticate the car for communications over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
  	\begin{itemize}
      \item Communications between car and phone
      \begin{itemize}     
        	\item NFC pairing for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
            \item Navigation history shared between app and car to improve destination suggestions
            \item Remote Control
            \item Media Control -- Song requests etc.
	  \end{itemize}
	  \item Communications between car and cloud (Over in-car LTE and external Wi-Fi if available)     	
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Synchronisation with user profiles
          \item System updates
          \item Map updates
          \item Streaming camera feeds
          \item API calls to the cloud
          \item Real time event data, for example someone is breaking into your car, car stats (warning lights)
        \end{itemize}
      \item Communications between phone and cloud      
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item Hashes and timestamps are compared on the server to decide what to synchronise
            \item API calls to the cloud
            \item Car camera feeds can be streamed to the phone on-demand over RTSP

            \item Real time event data from cloud eg someone breaking into your car, car stats (warning lights)
        \end{itemize}
	  \item Communications between car and external APIs (API links and mappings provided from cloud)
        % Talk about how it connects to the cloud which provides a link to the APIs       
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item Roadworks
            \item Traffic
            \item Weather
            \item Public Transport
            \item Note: All API calls are relative to the country the car is located in.
        \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Interaction Design} \label{sssec:interaction-design}
The interaction designs used on our product's interfaces were designed loosely based on designs from industry leading companies but tailored to integrate our ideas and implement some recurrent suggestions found throughout our research, which has seen over 100 responses.

    \end{itemize}
\subsection{Aesthetics/Graphical Design} \label{ssec:aesthetics}
% User Interfaces of the above devices
An effort was made to follow current styling standards used in industry to give the user a familiar experience, therefore flat designs were used where possible. Also characterising our design are large icons and avoidance of large swathes of text.

\section{Feature 1: Navigation} \label{sec:nav}

\subsection{Research} \label{ssec:nav-research}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Questionnaires
    \item Researching latest technology
  \end{itemize}
  
\subsection{Brainstorming} \label{ssec:nav-brainstorming}
% Should we cite our initial ideas document?
Our first stage of brainstorming was to create a Google Drive document, in which we started writing down our ideas while discussing them and generating further ideas through our discussions. During this initial stage, all ideas discussed were noted down and not removed, to keep the design space open and to encourage further discussion of it in a later iteration. After this initial stage, and an iteration of research, we went through this document and discussed as a group what is

An aid we found very useful was personas, a list of made-up personalities with realistic interests, jobs and attributes. During the brainstorming each of us tried to empathise with the different personas and think about their habits, things they enjoy, their mental states throughout different times of the day and from there, think of their needs, features they would enjoy and why.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Collectively worked together to put down all of our ideas into a google doc
		\item No ruling out of ideas
		\item Finally moved everything into a final document. Discussed each point as a group to decide what was worth expanding
        \item Things specific to the nav brainstorm i.e. the ideas to come out of it
	\end{itemize}
    
\subsection{Tech background} \label{ssec:nav-tech}

    \item Bidirectional A* search
    \item K-means clustering
  \end{itemize}

\section{Feature 2: App} \label{sec:app}

\subsection{Research} \label{ssec:app-research}
Research and brainstorming were conducted in a cyclic manner to ensure that the latest technologies relevant to this sector of the automotive industry were taken into consideration. Extensive research revealed that most leading companies such as Jaguar, BMW and Tesla already offer multi-platform mobile apps that compliment their automobiles. Each of the above boasts at least one of the features that we intended to integrate into our systems such as remote control and seamless route porting from smartphone to car. From brainstorming through to coding the prototype, our focus was directed on how to improve on existing products and also integrate our novel features. 
The research methods we used included a questionnaire, installing and using manufacturers apps on our mobile devices, browsing their websites and reading through papers and articles found through numerous searches on search engines.
