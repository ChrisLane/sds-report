\section{Overall system design}
\subsection{Overview}
\subsubsection{Algorithms}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Bidirectional A* Algorithm
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Heuristics
          \end{itemize}
      \item K means algorithm --- grouping convoys
      \item Learning algorithm --- user preferences, Contextually Aware Routing etc
      % FIND A LEARNING ALGORITHM
      \item Safety Detection algorithms
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Head pose algorithm
            \item Tesla radar system?
            \item Recognising bikes -- trained from training images which are bikes
            % This is if we are detecting bikes using this method of detecting bikes
        \end{itemize}
      
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Structures}
For our navigation algorithm we decided to model the map as a set of nodes and edges where junctions, the start and the destination are nodes and the edges are the roads between these nodes.
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Graph --- Representing streets and junctions as edges and nodes
    	
      \item Database --- SQLite for app storage    
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Storage}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Cloud storage - Oracle Database
          \begin{itemize}
          	  \item Updated from the car and app
              \item User Profiles
              % What is stored here, Car Loc, Settings, Routes (synced with phone), Privileges, seat preferences, driver stats 
              \item Convoy Groups
              % Data on member locations, group messages, routes, route changes etc
              \item Software updates
          \end{itemize}
      \item Car SSD Storage
      \begin{itemize}
      		\item Cached data from the cloud
            \item Cached data from applications such as Spotify
            \item Local music files
            \item Synchronised contacts from phone
            \item Dash cam footage
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Communications}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Communications between car and phone
      \begin{itemize}     
        	\item NFC pairing for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
            \item Navigation history shared between app and car to improve destination suggestions
            \item Remote Control
            \item Media Control -- Song requests etc.
	  \end{itemize}
	  \item Communications between car and cloud (Over in-car LTE and external Wi-Fi if available)     	
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Synchronisation with user profiles
          \item System updates
          \item Map updates
          \item Streaming camera feeds
          \item API calls to the cloud
          \item Real time event data, for example someone is breaking into your car, car stats (warning lights)
        \end{itemize}
      \item Communications between phone and cloud      
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item Hashes and timestamps are compared on the server to decide what to synchronise
            \item API calls to the cloud
            \item Car camera feeds can be streamed to the phone on-demand over RTSP
            \item Information regarding convoy setup on phone
            \item Car software updates from cloud (Gives ability to update car with phone)
            \item Real time event data from cloud eg someone breaking into your car, car stats (warning lights)
        \end{itemize}
	  \item Communications between car and external APIs (API links and mappings provided from cloud)
        % Talk about how it connects to the cloud which provides a link to the APIs       
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item Roadworks
            \item Traffic
            \item Weather
            \item Public Transport
            \item Note: All API calls are relative to the country the car is located in.
        \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Security}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Database encryption in the cloud
        \item HTTPS for all internet communications
        \item WPA2-PSK with AES for Wi-Fi hotspot login
        \item X509 certificate for the car

	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Interaction Design}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Centre console
        \item Mobile phone
        \item Rear side door device
        % Justifications of why we have chosen these interfaces
	\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Aesthetics/Graphical Design}
	% User Interfaces of the above devices
    An effort was made to follow current styling standards used in industry to give the user a familiar 	experience, therefore flat designs were used where possible. Also characterising our design are 		large icons and avoidance of large swathes of text.  
    \begin{itemize}
		\item Centre console
        \item Smaller navigation console above centre console
        \item Mobile phone
        \item Rear side door device
        % Justifications of why we have chosen these designs
